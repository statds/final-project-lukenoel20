# Introduction
The topic I have chosen is centered around the 311 Service Requests dataset from NYC Open Data, and I will be specifically looking at the "Complaint Type" column. I have chosen this topic because when exploring this dataset for the midterm, I found it interesting to see the different types of complaints people would call in to 311 and which were the most popular ones. I also saw that there were many noise related complaints and I am going to hone in on those in this project.

# Specific Aims

I have a few research questions I thought of all based on the "complaint type" column:

+ What are the most popular complaint types?
+ Do noise complaints specifically vary across boroughs?
+ Where would be best to live with the least amount of complaints?
+ Is there a relationship between time of day and frequency of certain complaint types?

# Data Description

I will be using the 311 Service Requests dataset from NYC Open Data, filtered to only include requests made from 1/15/2023 to 1/21/23, just as we used in the midterm. There are 54,469 rows and 41 variables in this dataset. Most variables are categorical (including two date/time columns), with the two main numerical columns being Latitude and Longitude. The main variable of interest is the "Complaint Type" column, although I will be using some other columns like "Borough" to illustrate.
